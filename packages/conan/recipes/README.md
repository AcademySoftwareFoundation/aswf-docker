# Conan Package Recipes

Many of these recipes are borrowed from the [Conan Center Index](https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index/tree/master/recipes),
but with quite a few modifications to allow the VFX versions to build, and with added settings to only allow Conan to resolve
ASWF-made packages and avoid ABI mixes with the Conan Center packages.

As the Conan Center Index is MIT licensed the whole subfolder here is also MIT licensed for consistency.
