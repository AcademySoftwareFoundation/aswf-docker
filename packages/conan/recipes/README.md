# Conan Package Recipes

Many of these recipes are borrowed from the [Conan Center Index](https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index/tree/master/recipes),
but a few modifications to allow all the VFX versions to build, avoid ABI mixes with the Conan Center packages.
The `python` setting has been added to better separate packages by python minor version.

As the Conan Center Index is MIT licensed the whole subfolder here is also MIT licensed for consistency.
